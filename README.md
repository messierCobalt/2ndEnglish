**HELLO ZEPP**,

I want you to make a choice. There's a slow-acting poison coursing through your system, which only I have the antidote for. Will you read this and test these programs, to save yourself?

Listen carefully, if you will. There's a *vision* :
- **modules** — make it easy.
    - **cases** — switch b/w character casings.
    - **CLI** — the backbone of every CLI programs.
- **chess** — simple CLI chess game.
- **ciphers** — simple game-like CLI based cipher... converter.
- **morse** — simple morse code en/decoder (CLI).
- **rpsls** — simple rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock... game (CLI).

**Please don't make me say:**
>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you, not anymore. GAME OVER!
